                    Biking refers to the activity of riding a bicycle, which is
                    a pedal-driven, two-wheeled vehicle. It's a popular form of
                    transportation, recreation, and exercise that involves using
                    leg power to propel the bike forward. Biking can be done on
                    various types of terrain, including roads, trails, and
                    off-road paths, and it offers numerous physical and mental
                    health benefits, as well as environmental advantages.

                        strength, and boost overall endurance. It's also great
                        for maintaining a healthy weight.

                        Cycling is an eco-friendly mode of transportation that
                        doesn't produce air pollution or noise pollution. By
                        choosing to ride a bike instead of drive, you can reduce
                        your carbon footprint and contribute to a cleaner
                        environment.
